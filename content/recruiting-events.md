### Permission Slip

If you would like to come to one of the above meetings, please bring this completed [permission slip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fBkzBuxIMfIprLwBjcdRPRiCMxd7mA_Y/view?usp=sharing "Permission Slip") with you.

## Regular Meetings

You are always welcome to check out our regular troop meetings from 7:00-8:30 PM on Tuesdays. Just be sure to email and let us know when you'd like to come! Some meetings/events are **_not_** held at the Shack so please do contact us before coming out so that we can let you know if we will be there.

## Adult Required

A parent or guardian must stay when you come to check out one of our meetings or recruiting events.  Once you are officially a member of the troop, your adult can drop you off and pick you up without staying for the whole event.  Until then, they must attend all troop events with you.

## Location and Directions

**Where we meet**: "The Shack," 28 Holly Court -- Far **west** end of Bollinger
Canyon Road in San Ramon. It’s a bit of a drive… but it’s worth it!

**Directions**: Take Bollinger Canyon Rd. west of Crow Canyon Rd. towards Las Trampas Park & Stables. After the 25 MPH sign, turn right at the “Fire Danger” sign onto Holly Ct (3.3 miles from Crow Canyon). If you’ve gone past the “Fire Danger” sign, you’ve gone too far!
