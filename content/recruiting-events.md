Some meetings/events are **_not_** held at the Shack so please do contact us before
coming out so that we can let you know if we will be there. Your parents are
welcome to visit as well!

## Special Recruiting Meetings

This Fall/Winter, we also have **special meetings** planned for new boys to check out Troop 834:

* Tuesday, November 9, 2021 @ 7PM… Scavenger Hunt - Get to know our scouts and have fun in our unique meeting space, "The Shack".
* Saturday, December 11, 2021 @ 1PM… Cub Scout Hike. Details to follow.
* Tuesday, January 11, 2022 @ 7PM… Campfire Tueday - Is there a better way to bond than over a campfire?
* Tuesday January 11 is also Parent Night - Parents have questions and we have answers.  The Cubs will work with the Boy Scouts while leadership helps the adults learn what's next.

Can't make it or missed these dates?  Don't worry!  You can stop by our troop at any time.  Just email newscout@bsatroop834.org to let us know that you'd like to come by.

### Permission Slip

If you would like to come to one of the above meetings, please bring this
completed [permission slip](/files/Troop834_Fall2021_RecruitingEvents_PermissionSlip.pdf) with you.

## Adult Required

A parent or guardian must stay when you come to check out one of our meetings or recruiting events.  Once you are officially a member of the troop, your adult can drop you off and pick you up without staying for the whole event.  Until then, they must attend all troop events with you.

## Location and Directions

**Where we meet**: "The Shack," 28 Holly Court -- Far **west** end of Bollinger
Canyon Road in San Ramon. It’s a bit of a drive… but it’s worth it!

**Directions**: Take Bollinger Canyon Rd. west of Crow Canyon Rd. towards Las Trampas Park & Stables. After the 25 MPH sign, turn right at the “Fire Danger” sign onto Holly Ct (3.3 miles from Crow Canyon). If you’ve gone past the “Fire Danger” sign, you’ve gone too far!
